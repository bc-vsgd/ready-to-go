# Ready to go - Exercise with React

Exercise made during fullstack developper bootcamp training provided by [Le Reacteur](https://www.lereacteur.io/).  
Fourth part: [React](https://react.dev/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-react-dev).

Purpose: when the 3 switches are in position 'On', we are 'Ready to go' ! - Use of `useState` hook and `onClick` props. 

Responsive app (breakpoints at 576px, 768px, 992px and 1200px).

Watch the result on [Netlify].

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
